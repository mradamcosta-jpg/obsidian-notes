### The “magic word” to reduce distractions

What if I told that a single “magic word” could instantly reduce your distractions—and help you follow through on your convictions—by at least 64%? That just a single word could do this for you—and that several scientific studies proved it worked? Do you think this would make an instant and dramatic change in your life?

I believe it would.

Let’s take a look at the proof so you can see for yourself.

In a [study](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/663212?uid=3739776&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21102001683777) for the Journal of Consumer Research, Vanessa Patrick and Henrik Hagtvedt measured the power of self-talk and how it affected distractions and follow-through.

Let’s review two of their experiments, and see how changing a single word produced tremendous results.

**In the first experiment**, 30 women attended a seminar on long-term health goals. After the seminar, researchers asked the women to join a program that helped them adopt a new health strategy (e.g. stop eating 12 cupcakes in a single sitting) by changing their self-talk—and then report how well that strategy worked for them.

The 30 women were divided into 3 separate groups:

 	
- Group A (“I can’t”): would say something like, “I *can’t* eat cupcakes because I’m on a diet.”
 	
- Group B (“I don’t”): would say something like, “I *don’t* eat cupcakes because I’m on a diet.”
 	
- Group C (“No”): adopted a “Just Say No” strategy.

The results?

Pause this video to take a moment to think about which group you think was most effective, and why?

 	
- Group A: “I can’t” 1/10 completed the program
 	
- **Group B: “I don’t” 8/10 completed the program**
 	
- Group C: “No” 3/10 completed the program

Let that sink in.

By substituting a single word—*don’t* for *can’t*—people were eight times more likely to succeed.

**In the second experiment,** 120 undergraduates were asked to use either “I can’t” or “I don’t” when faced with temptation.  Shortly after, the subjects were offered a granola bar versus a chocolate candy bar.

The results?

The “I don’t” group chose the healthy snack 64% more often than the “I can’t” group.

### **Bottom line: Use "I don't"**

**The next time you’re faced with temptation—whether it’s a distraction or otherwise—tell yourself “I *don’t*” instead of “I *can’t.*”**

Here are a few examples:

 	
- I don’t eat unhealthy snacks.
 	
- I don’t work after 5 p.m.
 	
- I don’t check email more than three times a day.
 	
- I don’t sacrifice my dreams for others’ petty requests.
 	
- I don’t talk about people behind their back.
