I've gotten into knots lately. Below are the knots I've learned so far. (Most videos are from the excellent [Animated Knots](https://www.animatedknots.com/) website.)

## Terminology

- **Working (or "bitter") end**: the part active in knot tying. (Fun fact: this is the where the term "to the bitter end" comes from.) 
- **Standing end**: the part *not* active in knot tying. Opposite of the working end.
- **Bight**: a length of rope that does not cross itself. For example, the first part of a [sheet bend](http://adam-costa.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4901&action=edit#sheet-bend). It can also mean the center part of a rope.
- **Loop knot**: a knot with a fixed loop size. In other words, the loop is not adjustable. For example, the [bowline](#bowline) is a popular loop knot.
- **Hitch**: a knot that attaches a rope to another object. For example, the [midshipman's hitch](#midshipmans-hitch). A hitch is similar to a loop knot, but with an adjustable loop.
- **Lashing**: used to secure two or more items together.
- **Stopper knot**: a knot that prevents a rope from slipping. The simplest stopper knot is the [overhand knot](#overhand-knot).

## Square knot

**What it's for:** tying down packages (especially boxes of cakes!) and first aid. I prefer the cakes.

The square knot is also useful for macramé (which my wife excels at); it's also the first part of tying your shoes (which I don't excel at).

## Bowline (pronounced "bo - lin")

**What it's for:** creating a loop on one end, which can be used to dock a boat or rescue someone.

## Sheet bend

**What it's for:** tying two equal (or unequal) sized ropes together.

## Midshipman’s hitch (aka taut line hitch)

**What it's for:** creating an adjustable loop at one end. Great for securing boats.

## Overhand knot

**What it's for:** tying the end of a rope—which prevents fraying—or as a stopper.

## Alpine butterfly loop

**What it's for:** tying a loop in the middle of a rope. This can be useful  if one side of the rope is damaged or if the ends are currently in use.

## Anchor hitch (aka fisherman's hitch)

**What it's for:** securing rope to an anchor, ring, or another line. Great for climbing. This is a very secure knot and is a better alternative to the clove hitch.

## Blake's hitch

**What it's for:** securing one line to another, with the first line sliding up and down the other. Great for rock climbers.

**How to do it:**

**Notes:** 

- At the beginning, keep your thumb on the rope for the first two loops. This makes it easier to add the hitch at the end.
- The end should be much longer than what's shown in the video. 
- For extra security, add a stopper—such as the double overhand knot—to the end. 
- The final threading goes *behind* the red rope.

## Figure-eight

**What it's for:** Serves as the beginning of the double figure-eight (see next knot below) to attach yourself to a harness for rock climbing. It can also be used as a stopper knot (but not as secure as a double overhand). 

**How to do it:**

Notes: 

- Start with slightly more than an arm's length (for attaching yourself to a harness; otherwise, use whatever length is needed).
- Make a bight. 
- Twist it to the right twice.
- Run the working end through the front of the loop.

## Double figure-eight into a harness

**What it's for:** securing a line into your harness; it's what ties you to end of the rope. A must-know for rock climbers.
