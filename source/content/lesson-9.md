### First: you *did* create your board, *right*?

This whole course is about living a 10x life—and to do that, you must **think deeply and act boldly**. If you haven’t already, create your board now.

As we’ve seen in several studies—writing your goals down increases your motivation and likelihood to achieve your goals.

### Prioritize your goals

To prioritize your goals, **go through each column and arrange each card in order of priority**, with the highest priority at the top, the second-highest beneath that, etc.

If you struggle with prioritizing goals, ask yourself the following questions:

 	
- *“Will this goal have a lasting impact on my life?”; and*
 	
- *“How long will it take me to achieve this goal?”*

For example, in Adam’s “*Where do I want to go*” column he listed *Japan*, *Antarctica,* and *space*. Obviously, they’ll all have a lasting impact on his life, but since going to space will take more time, money, and effort, he moved put Japan in the top spot.

Same goes for the “*What do I want to have*” column. Adam moved “*A bestselling book on Amazon*” ahead of “*$100,000 in passive monthly income*” because it will have a great impact, and will take less time to achieve than increasing his income to $100k per month.

**Bottom line: don’t sweat the details.** You can always rearrange your goals later; for now, we’re going to paint with broad strokes so we don’t waste time over-analyzing.

Two more quick steps:

 	
- Take the top 2 cards from each column and move them to the first column, called “Top priorities in my life.”
 	
- Prioritize those cards like you did for the other columns, putting the highest priority card at the top.

Yay!  Your Board Game of Life is done! Well, for now...

### How often should you update your Board Game of Life?

Your Board Game of Life is meant to inspire you.

 	
- **View it every day** for inspiration by looking at a printed copy OR on your computer.  Whatever works for you.
 	
- **Update it every 6 months**. The best way to do this is to set a reminder in your calendar six months down the road.

In the next lesson we’re going to move on to module 3 “Optimize Your Workflow" and show you an easy and effective way to track your goals―and achieve them!
