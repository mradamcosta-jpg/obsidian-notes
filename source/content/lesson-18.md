### Attention residue

**Attention residue** is when person’s attention is only partially focused on a current activity (task or social interaction) because a prior activity is still holding part of his or her attention.

Examples of attention residue:

 	
- Having dinner with friend while still thinking about a conversation from earlier in the day OR
 	
- Working on a new project while pondering how you could have solved another project a little better.

Attention residue is a nasty byproduct of procrastination.

It’s that same nagging feeling you get, when you don’t finish what you started.

### Completion vs. closure

And according to a [study](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.183.1776&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Sophie Leroy—published in the journal *Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes*—attention residue is a real thing.

This residue gets *all* up in your brain’s business when you prematurely switch tasks.

The study says you need two things to wipe your mind clean of attention residue: completion and closure.

 	
- ***Completion*** means the job is done.
 	
- ***Closure*** means you’re mentally done with the job.

Here’s an example:

Let’s say you’re working a dead-end job for a major asshole of a boss.

One day your boss asks you to make him a cup of coffee.

You decide…

“*Screw this, I quit. I didn’t want to work here, anyway.*”

That’s *closure*—not completion.

Why? Because your mentally done with the job even though you didn’t make him coffee.

Now, let’s rewind. Rather than quit, you knuckle down and make your boss a cup of coffee. Later, on the car ride home—pissed at your boss’s insulting request—you can’t help but think I should have spit in his coffee too that fat bastard!

That’s *completion*—not closure.

Why? Because you completed your work, but you’re still thinking about it.

Leroy—argues that, without completion *and* closure, we cannot focus on our next task.

The lesson?

**You need completion *and* closure before moving on to your next task.**

### Using your kanban for completion and closure

In your kanban, to get

 	
- *completion*, set up each task as a SMART goal. (Remember, SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely.)
 	
- *closure*, move your Trello card from the “Doing” to the “Done” column.

See how that works?

Your kanban lets you clearly define your task (making it clear when you’ve *completed* it) and gives you *closure* by visually and physically moving the card to the “Done” column.

Please do not underestimate the power of completion and closure. They ensure progress, improve your focus, and boost your morale.
