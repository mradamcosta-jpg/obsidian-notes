### The Game of Life

The board game called “***The Game of Life***” simulates a person's journey through life, from college to retirement, with jobs, marriage, and children along the way.

But this game has it all wrong. * Why?*

There is no one-life-fits-all.

### Happiness Equation

Happiness is a simple equation:

**Knowing what you want + Doing what you want = Happy**

### Board Game of Life in Trello

Let’s create our Board Game of Life so we can decide what a winner really looks like.

Remember those ten questions you answered yesterday? Did you answer them?

I hope so—because we’re gonna put them into your personal Board Game of Life using a free online tool called Trello.

To get started with Trello, you’ll need to:

 	
- Create a free [Trello](https://trello.com/) account (if you don’t have one already);
 	
- Access the “10x: Board Game of Life” template here:

 	
  - **[https://trello.com/b/7pDMJv3v/10x-life-the-board-game-of-life](https://trello.com/b/7pDMJv3v/10x-life-the-board-game-of-life)**

 	
- Copy the board so you can use it for your goals

I’ve included a second video that walks you through how to get started with Trello so be sure to watch that before diving right in.

In the next lesson, you're going to start adding your hopes, dreams, and desires to your own personal “Board Game of Life."
