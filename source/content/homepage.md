## Free course #1: The Productivity Course 

Would you like to become more focused, productive, and achieve 10x results in your life and business?

Then I suggest you start with the [free Productivity Course](https://adam-costa.com/productivity-course/). (There are 7 chapters; each is between 2–3,000 words long.)

You'll discover how to:

- define what you want from life (and how to get it).
- **increase your results by up to 10x. **
- create a rock-solid set of good habits that force you to improve every day, practically on autopilot.
- **trust yourself to achieve your goals—**by using a proven system for self-improvement.
- **use manifestation and visualization techniques the right way** (which almost nobody does).
- **block the three types of distraction**.
- **stop procrastinating**.
- **define your goals**—in a fun, easy way that’s like playing a board game.
- **conserve your willpower**—so you can use it when you need it most.
- **get rid of anxiety**.
- **boost your productivity**.
- **improve your self-esteem and discipline**—in as little as 5 minutes a day. 
- use business project management tools like kanban, scrum, and agile to **achieve breakthrough success**.
- follow through on everything—and **discover the “magic word” that increases follow-through by 61%**.

## Free course #2: The Financial Freedom Course 

Would you like to become wealthy—truly wealthy—where you have the time, money, and energy to work on projects you love?

Then check out my [free Financial Freedom course](https://adam-costa.com/financial-freedom/). I created this course for my nieces and nephews to ensure they got a solid education in personal finance; you'll probably find it useful, too.

**In this course you'll discover how to:**

- **find out *****exactly***** how much money you need** to become truly financially independent.
- **slash your expenses—by living like royalty.** (My wife and I once saved over $100,000 in a single year using the strategies outlined in this course.)
- **purchase and sell businesses for fun and profit.**
- **work remotely.** (This is perhaps the most important part for many people, but is right for you? Find out in the course!)
- **negotiate pay raises.**
- **invest wisely**, using proven methods that can deliver long-term results.
- **minimize taxes**—by using little-known tactics that are **100% legal, ethical, and a whole lot of fun**! (Seriously. This may be the only time "fun" and "taxes" ever belong in the same sentence.)
- **build assets**, so you can increase your income—and more importantly, your freedom.

## Hoo-rah, you made it to the bottom of the page!
