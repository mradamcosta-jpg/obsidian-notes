Now, we're going to let you in on a little secret...

Even though you've answered the 10 questions, **you won’t know your purpose until you act**.

*Why you ask?*

[A study at the University of Michigan](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656697921620) found that people define their work in ways:

 	
- **Job** (for financial rewards and necessity, rather than pleasure or fulfillment)
 	
- **Career** (for advancement)
 	
- **Calling** (for enjoyment of fulfilling socially useful work)

Here’s where it gets interesting:

No matter which profession researchers looked into—from clerical to professional—one third of people defined their work as a job; another third, a career; and the final third, a calling.

Their occupation didn’t matter. Whether they were janitors, lawyers, doctors, or drug dealers, people either found purpose in what they did—or they didn’t.

The fact is…

**You don’t know how important something is until you start doing it.  **Purpose is not an answer. It’s not a question. It’s an action. We have no idea if something lights our fires until we try it.

Don't worry... We'll show you how in the next lesson.

To wrap up the first module, you learned:

The power of purpose and 3 scientific studies that showed how purpose can help you enjoy better health, spend less time in a hospital, and even live longer.

How to create a **virtuous cycle** in your life by:

 	
- i) defining your purpose,
 	
- ii) creating goals aligned with that purpose,
 	
- iii) building routines to achieve those goals, and
 	
- iv) turning those routines into habits that are aligned with your goals.

The 10 essential questions to help you define your purpose.
