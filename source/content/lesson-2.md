## Lesson Summary

We are going to dive into the first module “find your purpose”. In this module, you’ll discover:

 	
- the surprising health benefits of purpose;
 	
- how purpose creates a virtuous cycle in your life; and
 	
- 10 questions to answer to help you define your purpose

In the words of Oprah: ***"Your true passion should feel like breathing; it’s that natural.”***

But what if you haven’t found a true passion or your life’s purpose?

Everyone has a purpose.

Let that sink in... **YOU HAVE A PURPOSE. You just need to find it.**

And that's where we come in (wink-wink).

In the next lesson, we'll share the exact questions you need to ask yourself to find your life's purpose.
