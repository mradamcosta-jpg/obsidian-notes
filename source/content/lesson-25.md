### Distraction blocking tools

Why we don’t use tools to block distractions?

**Answer**: Using distraction blocking tools is a crutch and similar to saying “I can’t”.

Having said that, I know a lot of people get value from these tools, so I’ve included a quick round-up of popular distraction blocking. They are:

 	
- [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en). A Chrome extension that blocks time-wasting sites.
 	
- [FocusBooster](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/). Focus on single tasks for 25 minutes apiece. (This is based on the [Pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/), which I’ve found useful for writing.)
 	
- [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/). Tracks time spent on applications and websites, giving you an accurate picture of your day.

### Block distractions—by saying "no" man

Have you seen the movie *Yes Man*?

It’s hilarious. Jim Carrey wants to live better, so he starts saying “yes” to *everything*, including travel, rock concerts, and blowjobs from geriatric broads. By the end, the world’s a better place, and he winds up with Zooey Deschanel.

It’s a great movie, with a feel-good moral: say yes, embrace the unexpected, and live a more exciting, fulfilling life.

But there's one problem.  It's not true.

**Say “no” more often; you’ll love the results.**

Do you know this feeling?

 	
- Your boss (or mother, or spouse) asks you to do something—and you *know* they’d be better off doing it themselves?
 	
- You’re stuck between two people—who have *just* enough brains between them to make an idiot—and it’s clear they *should* be able to solve their problem, without needing your monkey-ass in the middle?

Distractions are everywhere. And we must say “no” to them before they waste one more precious minute of our ever-decreasing time.

Look, distractions are not deathbed-worthy. You’ll never lie on your deathbed—eyes reeling back in your skull—and lament, “*Why did I only watch each season of Ice Road Truckers twice? Why not thrice, dammit? WHY NOT THRIIIIIIICE!!!*.”

### How to just say "no":

 	
- Go to your kanban board
 	
- Pick one card/task from your backlog and delete it
 	
- Repeat
 	
- Optional: Create a “Not-To-Do” list

### Not To-Do List

Many productive people—including Michael Hyatt and Tim Ferriss—swear by the “Not To-Do List.” That’s cool. I like that idea. Plus, when you write down—and more importantly, internalize—your Not-To-Do List, you’re embracing the powerful phrase “I don’t” instead of “I can’t” that we’ve seen work oh-so-well in this module.

### 8 simple, proven steps to identify—and eradicate—procrastination

In [an article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200310/ending-procrastination) in Psychology Today, professor of psychology Dr. Joseph Ferrari recommends these strategies for reducing procrastination:

 	
1. Make a list of everything you have to do.
 	
2. Write a statement of intention.
 	
3. Set realistic goals.
 	
4. Break it down into specific tasks.
 	
5. Make your task meaningful.
 	
6. Promise yourself a reward.
 	
7. Eliminate tasks you never plan to do. Be honest!
 	
8. Estimate the amount of time you think it will take you to complete a task. Then increase the amount by 100%.

Let’s see how this list connects with what you’ve done so far throughout this course…

 	
- You’ve created your kanban board that lists everything you need to do. In your kanban, you have a backlog of items that you may or may not do.
 	
- You’ve gone through your backlog and deleted at least one item so you feel in control. This gives you autonomy.
 	
- You’ve made sure each task is a SMART goal, and that it is specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and timely.
 	
- You’ve created your Game Board of Life to help you identify—and visualize—what matters most to you; this ensures each task is meaningful.
 	
- You’ll enjoy a sense of accomplishment whenever you move a completed task into your “Done” column in your kanban.

Dr. Joseph Ferrari’s list of 8 steps to identify—and eradicate—procrastination is similar to what we done in this course, right? Except our list is a specific framework you can build on further as needed.
