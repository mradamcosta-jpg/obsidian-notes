### 3 ways to boost your willpower

In the previous lesson, you learned willpower is drained throughout the day, like a tank of gas.

Here are 3 easy ways to keep your willpower tank topped up:

#### First, eat fruit to keep your glucose levels up.

Glucose is a carbohydrate that helps our cells and organs function; glucose is also the only energy our brains can use.  Each time you make a decision, you lose glucose—which reduces your willpower. A [study](http://www.uky.edu/~njdewa2/gailliotetal07JPSP.pdf) published in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* showed that acts of self-control decreased blood glucose levels; it also demonstrated that low levels of glucose predicted poor performance on a subsequent self-control task.  Interestingly, when subjects were given lemonade to boost their glucose levels, their self-control improved. But when they were given sugar-free lemonade, their self-control remained low. So if you're feeling run down, eat a piece of fruit—and boost your self-control.

#### Second, attach meaning to what you're doing (or not doing).

A research team led by Mark Muraven, Ph.D., of the University at Albany, discovered that subjects who were forced to exert self-control (e.g. in order to please others) were more easily depleted than people acting on their own beliefs and goals.

As you probably guessed by now, the importance of setting up your Game Board of Life and kanban boards will help you attach meaning to your work—and boost your willpower

It makes sense, right? I mean, if someone asked you to shovel donkey poop, you wouldn't do it, right? But if you needed to feed your family (a meaningful goal if there ever was one), you’d be whistling while you worked.

#### Third, improve your mood to boost your self-control.

The same study showed that participants, who received surprise gifts or watched comedy videos, increased their self-control. So the next time you're feeling down, watch comedy.

### Preserve willpower through routines

The secret to 10x your willpower is to avoid using your willpower. And the best way to avoid draining your willpower is through routines.

Routines don’t require willpower because you do them subconsciously. The more you remove decision-making from your daily routines, the more willpower and stamina you'll have to focus on what matters.

That’s why Barack Obama only wears blue or gray suits. By reducing the number of small decisions he makes, he preserves his willpower for important decisions.

We’ll discuss how to preserve your willpower through routines in the next module.

### What to do next

 	
- **Identify when you feel drained—and solve it.** Is it because your glucose is low? Are you in a bad mood? Or does your work feel meaningless? Once you’ve identified the cause, take steps to fix it. The solution may be as simple as drinking a glass of lemonade, explaining why your work is important, or doing something to boost your mood.
 	
- **Make fewer decisions.** Each decision drains your willpower; save your willpower for important decisions, and use routines for the rest. Eat the same meals. Wear the same clothes. Embrace routines.

### Module summary

You learned all about willpower, and why it’s overrated.

You discovered three simple ways to keep your willpower tank from running on empty. Those three things are to:

 	
- manage your glucose levels,
 	
- attach meaning to your work, and
 	
- improve your mood.

You also learned that willpower is limited and that you preserve willpower through *routines*.

Congratulations! You just finished part 1 of the course.

Now that you have a crystal-clear view of your life, it's time to zoom in and start developing routines, blocking distractions, and following through like a champion.
