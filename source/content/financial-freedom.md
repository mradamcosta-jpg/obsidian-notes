## How to achieve financial independence, travel the world, and live off your investments forever

**In order to reach financial freedom, conventional wisdom tells us:**

- Go to a good school. 

- Work until you're 65.

- Live the good life. 

But what if conventional wisdom had it backward?

What if you could become financially independent by traveling more, working less, and living in nicer homes?

The fact is: you can.

If you apply the techniques in this book you can reach financial freedom in as little as 10 years (assuming you start from zero). We'll cover the math behind this in the first two chapters.
