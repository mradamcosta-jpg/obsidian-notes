### Multiple Kanbans

You’ve already created one master kanban board, which you use every day. However, some cards—especially large projects like “write a book” or “run a marathon”—may require their own project kanban board.

Here’s our advice:

**Create a temporary, standalone board for larger projects.** It helps you focus on the big picture and quickly set up tasks to complete the project.

 	
- **Master Kanban**

 	
  - Contains your top priority goals and *all *your to-dos
 	
  - Ongoing

 	
- **Project Kanban**

 	
  - A separate kanban for large projects
 	
  - Temporary
 	
  - Create a card for your project in your master kanban in the "Doing" column (e.g. "write a book"). Create a separate project kanban for all the project tasks (e.g. write first draft, hirer editor, etc.).  Set up the columns however you wish, since the columns don't have to follow the master kanban structure of ("backlog", "to-do", "doing", "done"). Once the project is complete, archive the project kanban and move the card in your master kanban to the "Done" column.

Keep in mind: each project-specific kanban will go away once you finish the project, whereas your main board will continue to grow and change over time.

### Backward design

Here’s a quick and easy way to break down large projects using backward design.

Backward design helps you answer the dreaded question: “*Where do I start?*”

To do this, begin with the end-goal in mind, then work your way backward from that.

For example, my goal was to publish a book.  So I started with the end-goal “publish a book,” then added steps backward from that, including:

 	
- **END-GOAL: Publish book**
 	
- Format the book for Kindle
 	
- Hire an editor
 	
- Hire a book cover designer
 	
- Finish the final copy
 	
- Make final edits (based on reader feedback)
 	
- Write 3rd revision
 	
- Write 2nd revision
 	
- Write 1st revision (rough draft)
 	
- Create book outline
 	
- Determine target audience
 	
- **STEP 1: Research the market**

See how that works?

By starting with the end in mind, it’s easy to work backward, getting increasingly tactical until we finally have our full plan laid out for us in a clear, easy-to-understand format.

### Use your kanban with the help of reminders

Kanban will change your life—**if you *****use it***. And the easiest way to use your kanban is: keep it in front of you.

 	
- Set your kanban as your homepage in your internet browser
 	
- Post your kanban on cubical wall, refrigerator, bathroom mirror, etc.
 	
- Pin your kanan so it'll open every time you launch Chrome

 	
  - Right click the kanban tab
 	
  - Click "Pin Tab"

 	
- Set your kanban as the default for a new tab in Chrome

 	
  - Install the [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en) Chrome extension
 	
  - Set the options
 	
  - Enter the URL of your kanban board

By now, I’m sure you can see the power of using a kanban; the flexibility lets you course-correct with whatever spitballs life throws at you.

### Module 3 "Optimize Your Workflow" Summary

In this module, you created your kanban from the top cards in your Board Game of Life. In doing so, you’re now able to focus on the biggest goals in your life on a day-to-day basis, and ensure you're continually improving and working toward your goals.

You also discovered the difference between *capacity* and *flow—*and why you should always optimize for flow.

You also learned and set up SMART goals, which are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely.

You also learned how to set reminders to view your kanban throughout the day-a proven psychological method to help you achieve your goals.
