### Module 3: Optimize your workflow

In this module, you’ll:

 	
- **get a simple step-by-step process to prioritize your workflow.**
 	
- understand the difference between *capacity* and *flow*—and why they’re key to achieving your goals.
 	
- **visualize your work and limit your work-in-progress (WIP).**
 	
- define SMART goals to set you up for success.
 	
- **discover why To-Do lists are slowing your down—and what to do instead.**

And, as usual, you’ll get real, actionable, and proven methods to succeed.

### Introducing kanban

Kanban (pronounced “Kahn-Bahn”) is Japanese for “a card you can see and touch.” Using a kanban system, you move cards through a board—similar to what we did in Trello in the previous chapter—to help you visualize your workflow through different stages.

In their book [*Personal Kanban*](http://amzn.to/1O7enI2), Jim Benson and Tonianne Barry highlight two rules:

 	
- visualize work
 	
- limit your work-in-progress (WIP)

#### Visualize work and limit WIP

Kanban—or a *kanban board*—is a *visual* and *kinesthetic* representation of your work.

**Kanban is superior to traditional To-Do lists because it:**

 	
- provides *context*.
 	
- visually highlights trade-offs between choosing one item over another.
 	
- lets you physically “move” items throughout your workflow (instead of just checking them off a To-Do list, never to be seen again).

Kanban is also excellent for identifying *bottlenecks*—so you can constantly improve your processes.

#### Kanban columns

A simple kanban includes four columns:

 	
- **Backlog **– everything you might want to do
 	
- **To****-****Do **– things you’re going to do in near future
 	
- **Doing** – things you’re doing right now
 	
- **Done** – things that are done

#### Create your kanban system

You can either copy the [10x Life: Kanban board template](https://trello.com/b/cwtbxRqc/10x-life-kanban) or create it from scratch.

To create a Trello kanban board:

 	
- Log into Trello
 	
- Click “Boards” in the top left of the page.
 	
- Click “Create New Board”
 	
- Name it Kanban
 	
- Add a list for each kanban column (Backlog, To-Do, Doing, Done)

Nice!

Your kanban will change your life. It is, without a doubt, **the single biggest factor in achieving your dreams**. And we’ll explain exactly *how* in future lessons lesson.

For now, take some time to add your to-do's in your kanban.  Think big and small.  Remember, your backlog list is a brain dump so go crazy.

In the next lesson, we’re going to look at the difference between capacity and flow and dive into SMART goals.
