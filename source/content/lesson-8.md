### Getting started with Trello

If you missed the last lesson, go to the previous lesson and watch the video lesson on getting started with Trello to learn how to create an account, copy a board, and add cards.

### Adding cards to Trello

It's time to add your hopes, dreams, and desires to your "Board Game of Life."

Start in the second column, answer each question, listing off everything—and yes, I do mean everything—that comes to mind.

Add images for each card to make your answers more “real”—and therefore, stick in your subconscious longer.

**Quick psychological tip**: select pictures seen from the first-person point of view.

Why?

When you use pictures from your point of view, you’re stapling that image right into your thought-skull. You’re inside that experience. And once you’re inside, you’re waaaay more likely to keep going.

That’s why companies offer free samples, free trials, and, yes—advertisements that use images from your point of view. It gets you inside the product or service, without even using it.

Continue adding your answers (aka cards) with first-person images until you have at least 3 answers for each question (aka list).

In the next lesson, we're going to prioritize your answers.
