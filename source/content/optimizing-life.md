Recently I've come to the conclusion that the best-lived life is one with the most time spent in a flow state. The more time people spend in a flow state—where everything else disappears except for the activity at hand—the happier they tend to be.

This is backed by science. In the classic book Flow, the author outlilnes how people can enter the flow state. 

So, if the meaning of life is to be happy, and people are happiest in a flow state, it's pretty obvious what we should optimize for: time spent in a flow state. 

But how?

## What is flow?

## How to enter flow

## How to measure flow

## How to optimize for flow

Some random thoughts on my education

- Use free online textbooks and book summaries to get high-quality concise information on a wide variety of topics.
- Take that information and place it into Anki via spreadsheet.
- The above works best for information (e.g. facts, figures). 
- For hands-on learning (e.g. rock climbing), take live group classes. 
- Balancing both styles of learning ensure I learn fast without being a hermit. It should also help improve flow.
