### Science behind goal setting

2 scientifically proven reasons to set your goals:

 	
1. **Setting goals increases ****motivation **(*[Click here to read study.](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1967-09780-001))*
 	
2. **Setting goals increases ****achievement by up to 30% **(*[Click here to read study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20230067)*)

**Key point: **write your goals down!

### 10 questions to map out goals

The following ten questions will reveal exactly what you want from life—and in the next chapter, we’ll focus on how to achieve them.

 	
- What do I want to do?
 	
- What do I want to be?
 	
- What do I want to see?
 	
- Where do I want to go?
 	
- What do I want to have?
 	
- Who do I want to spend more time with?
 	
- What would be the most fun thing to do?
 	
- What activity do I want to stop doing?
 	
- What is missing in my life?
 	
- What’s stopping me from achieving everything in this list

Take some time now to answer these questions as honestly as you can. Dream your dream, not someone else’s. Go absolutely buck-wild, and write down as many ideas as you can. And most importantly, make your goals BIG, BOLD, and BALLSY. Need a little help?  Here are Adam's answers:

 	
- What do I want to do? (Hike the Appalachian Trail, run a 50-mile marathon, learn to surf, etc.)
 	
- What do I want to be? (Kind, smart, loving, helpful, respected, etc.)
 	
- What do I want to see? (Sunset over the Sahara, a dolphin in the wild, two monkeys playing pool, etc.)
 	
- Where do I want to go? (Tibet, Antarctica, space, etc.)
 	
- What do I want to have? ($100K in monthly passive income, a bestselling book on Amazon, my own restaurant, etc.)
 	
- Who do I want to spend more time with? (Parents, Jim Rogers, Fabio, etc.)
 	
- What would be the most fun thing to do? (Take a hot air balloon to the upper atmosphere, run with the bulls in Pamplona, ski naked, etc.)
 	
- What activity do I want to stop doing? (Answering emails, commuting to work, wallowing in self-doubt, giving in to others’ demands when I know I shouldn’t, etc.)
 	
- What is missing in my life? (Adventure, a sense of accomplishment, a fulfilling job, etc.)
 	
- What’s stopping me from achieving everything in this list? (Note: be specific. Say “$1,337 to buy a plane ticket to Spain” instead of, “money.”)

In the next lesson, you'll discover how to really win at the game of life AND get an overview of the tool we use everyday to stay organized and achieve our goals.
