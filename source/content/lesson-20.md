### Associative trigger

Good triggers are vital to building effective routines.

For example, when I was training for my first 50k, I put my running clothes on the floor next to my bed. I had to step over my running clothes every morning—and as a result, I never missed a workout.

Putting my running clothes beside my bed is an example of an **associative trigger**—a cue that you associate with an actual habit or routine.

*Why?*

Because I associate wearing my running clothes with actually running.

Associative triggers—such as listening to the same music or arranging your desk in a certain way—tell your mind it’s time to get down to work.

Your kanban is a powerful associative trigger. When you look at your kanban board throughout the day, you’re building associative triggers to ensure you complete your most important tasks. Like stepping over my running clothes in the morning, your kanban is front-and-center, reminding you to focus on what matters.

### Ultradian rhythms

**Ultradian rhythm**: regular period or cycle repeated throughout a day.

Respecting your ultradian rhythms will make you happier—and more effective.

Research done by Peretz Lavie and Associates from the Institute of Technology, Haifa, show that we work optimally in roughly 90-minute cycles; after that, we get distracted.

The study suggests you work for 90 minutes then take 20 minutes off. During your 20-minute break, get away from your work; go outside, talk to friends, exercise—*anything* that gives your brain and body the time it needs to recharge—before you get back to work.

**Key point: work for 90 minutes, then rest for 20 minutes to recharge.**

### Do this:

 	
- Establish hard edges to your day. Remember these are the start and stop points for your projects or work.
 	
- Develop routines that provide *completion* and *closure*.
 	
- Use associative triggers to help you stick to your routines.
 	
- Work for 90 minutes; take a break for 20.
