### 3 types of distractions

 	
- tactical distractions,
 	
- strategic distractions, and
 	
- procrastination.

Let’s take a closer look…

### Tactical Distraction

**A**** t****actical distraction** is an interruption that shifts your focus away from your work.

It’s when you’re working on the right thing, but get distracted by checking Facebook or email. Or when a coworker barges in and starts running their mouth about… whatever.

There are two main ways to overcome tactical distractions.

 	
- Use tools that block distractions (like a browser extension that blocks social media sites).
 	
- Avoid getting distracted in the first place.

Avoiding distractions in the first place is more important because it is internal and something that you can carry with you for the rest of your life. It becomes a habit, and, as we've seen, habits are what define you. We’ll discuss how to overcome tactical distractions more in future lessons.

### **Strategic distraction**

**Strategic distractions** is when you're working on tasks that aren’t in-line with your goals, preventing you from giving your full attention to achieving your goals.  It's when you’re working on the wrong thing entirely. The work itself is a distraction.

Has this happened to you?

You grind away, throughout the day, and feel great. The day goes by and—looking back—the cold, hard truth hits you between the eyes: it was all just busy work.  We’re a culture of busy work. A culture who celebrates multitasking and so-called productivity at the expense of contemplation, reflection, and living with a greater sense of purpose.

To avoid strategic distraction, you need to clearly define your most important goals.

Fortunately, we've already accomplished this with your Board Game of Life.  Your Board Game of Life will provide the answers you need—and inoculate you from strategic distractions. The next time you feel uncertain about the importance of your work, just go back to your Board Game and see if it ties into your main goals. If it does, great; if not, select an item from your Board Game and get to work.

### Procrastination

**Procrastination**: delaying or postponing something.

Unlike strategic and tactical distractions, procrastination is a form of distraction that prevents you from even getting started.

Procrastination is shockingly common. In a recent [study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200308/procrastination-ten-things-know), 20% of people identify themselves as chronic procrastinators. And that number soars to 70% for college students.

Why do we procrastinate?

Psychologists cite many possible explanations: a defense mechanism against overbearing parents, a desire to avoid responsibility, a compensation for fear of failure (or success), or even a thrill-seeking desire to work under pressure.

Regardless of the reason, the effects of procrastination are devastating. According to a study at the University of Windsor, chronic procrastinators—again, that’s 20% of the general population—suffer more health issues due mainly to higher levels of stress.

It’s not just the procrastinator that suffers. As Dr. Timothy A. Pychyl puts it in *Psychology Today*, “*In the name of ‘working better under pressure,’ too often social engagements are canceled, promises are broken, and favors called in to have others problem solve last-mi**nute catastrophes (a jammed printer becomes a national emergency). Anyone within the vicinity suffers the intense pressure of the looming deadline. Procrastination harms relationships at home and at work.*”

Let’s face it: procrastination stops you from accomplishing your goals, and—no matter how much you may want that new job, new car, or published book—it *ain’t* gonna happen if you don’t get started.

**Lao-tzu**, the Chinese philosopher, said: “*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.*”

Actually,  as it turns out—a more accurate translation would be “*The journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one's feet*.”

**The difference is subtle, but important.**

Rather than focus on the importance of a single step, Lao-tzu emphasized that action came from stillness. In other words, you already have everything you need to get started.

### Summary

 	
- **Tactical distractions **are when you get distracted while working on the right thing
 	
- **Strategic distractions **are when you’re working on the wrong thing entirely
 	
- **Procrastination** is when you're not working at all
