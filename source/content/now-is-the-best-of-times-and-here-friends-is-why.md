> Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in.
—Leonard Cohen

I feel like Dr. Pangloss...

... except unlike that thin caricature, my lanky make up of bones, hair, and belly fat believes that **we truly *do* live in the best of times**—and I can prove it.

Please listen.

I know that you're reading this at some distant point after I wrote it... and yet... I truly believe this is a chance to make a real difference in the world.

**Because while we plan, the gods laugh.**

And many of our plans are weak... uninformed... and frankly, overly pessimistic.

I'm not a pessimist. Just an optimist proved wrong by reality.

And in my darkest moments—when grey clouds mute palettes, while I drown in a cacophony of silence—I think the world is on its own.

But even in my darkest moments, I take solace. I take solace in the fact that the facts factually that **WE ARE LIVING IN THE BEST OF ALL TIMES**.

And you'd be a damn fool to think otherwise.
